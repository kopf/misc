Written to ensure all old foobar2000 ratings were added to navidrome (after they'd gone missing in the fb2k->kodi migration years ago)

Which is also why the script only adds ratings to navidrome where navidrome has a rating of `0`

Steps - 
* export an xml of foobar2000 playback statistics (select tracks, rightclick, playback statistics, export xml)
* read the script
* run the script
